                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Emma Packard and I am a Sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I am currently an Integrated Strategic Communications major with an emphasis in Public Relations and a minor in Multimedia Communications. My hometown is Antigo, Wisconsin which a little over two hours from Eau Claire. Fun fact: I transfered to Eau Claire in fall of 2021!</p>
                <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                <p>As someone going into Communications and Public Relations, there are a few goals I hope to achieve in my career. I hope to someday work for a non-profit group or company in Public Relations. One of my biggest passions in helping others and I strive to continue this in my career!</p>
